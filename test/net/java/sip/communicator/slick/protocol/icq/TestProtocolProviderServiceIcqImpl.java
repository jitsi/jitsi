/**
 * Test icq/aim specific behaviour for OSCAR (AIM/ICQ) implementations of the
 * protocol provider service. The class would basically test that registration
 * succeeds, that the provider registration state is updated accordingly and
 * that the corresponding registration change events are generated and dispatched.
 *
 * In the case of a registration failure we try to remain consistent and do
 * assertions accordingly.
 *
 * It is important to note that it is critical to execute tests in this class
 * in a particular order because of protocol limitations (we cannot login and
 * logoff to most of the existing protocol services as often as we'd like to).
 * This is why we have overridden the suite() method which kind of solves the
 * problem but adds the limitation of making extending developers manually add
 * the tests they write to the suite method.
