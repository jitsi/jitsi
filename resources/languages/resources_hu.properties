# Jitsi, the OpenSource Java VoIP and Instant Messaging client.
#
# Distributable under LGPL license.
# See terms of license at gnu.org.
#
# Translation files are automatically generated from:
#
#        http://translate.jitsi.org/
#
# Note to translators:
# - do not edit the resources_xx.properties files directly. Your changes
#   may be lost. Go to http://translate.jitsi.org/ instead.
# - {0}, {1}... are parameters which will be replaced by the
#   actual text at runtime, place them as you wish
# - \ at the end of a line means that the translation is continued
#   in the next line
# - you cannot use single quotes when a parameter is used in the sentence.
#   For example, <You can't move contact {0}>, <Contact {0} doesn't exist>,
#   or <Accept '{0}'> does not display correctly. In such cases, you need
#   to use double quotes (''):
#   <You can''t move contact {0}>, <Contact {0} doesn''t exist>, or
#   <Accept ''{0}''>
#
# To start Jitsi with a language that is different
# from your system's language, pass the language code to ant:
# ant -Duser.language=xx run
