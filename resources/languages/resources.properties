#   actual text at runtime, place them as you wish
# - \ at the end of a line means that the translation is continued

# - you cannot use single quotes when a parameter is used in the sentence.
#   For example, <You can't move contact {0}>, <Contact {0} doesn't exist>,
#   or <Accept '{0}'> does not display correctly. In such cases, you need
#   to use double quotes (''):
#   <You can''t move contact {0}>, <Contact {0} doesn''t exist>, or
#   <Accept ''{0}''>
