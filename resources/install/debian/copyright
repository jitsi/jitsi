 This jar was created by decompiling AppleJavaExtensions.jar (completely consistent
 with its BSD-like license), and adding the new Java 5 methods.
 .
 Apple's license does not specify that their copyright notice should be included
 in modified versions (only complete, unmodified ones), so I'm putting it under 3-clause
 BSD just to protect myself from liability.
