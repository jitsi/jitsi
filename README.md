Jitsi Desktop
=============

Jitsi Desktop is a free open-source audio/video and chat communicator that
supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP/Jabber, IRC and many other useful features.

Please do not confuse this project
with [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet), the online video
conferencing solution with a free instance at https://meet.jit.si.

## Support

Jitsi Desktop is the heritage of Jitsi Meet. While some components are still
used in e.g. [Jigasi](https://github.com/jitsi/jigasi), the project is not
actively developed anymore. Improvements, bugfixes and builds are entirely based
on community contributions.
