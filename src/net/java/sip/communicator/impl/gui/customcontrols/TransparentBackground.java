/**
 * The <tt>TransparentBackground</tt> is a <tt>JComponent</tt>, which is
 * added to a <tt>Window</tt> in order to make it transparent.
 * <p>
 * <b>How to use the <tt>TransparentBackground</tt>?</b>
 * The <tt>TransparentBackground</tt> is created and added to the content pane
 * of the <tt>Window</tt> that should be made transparent. All other components
 * then are added to the <tt>TransparentBackground</tt> component and not
 * directly to the window content pane.
 * <p>
 * <b>How it works?</b>
 * The <tt>TransparentBackground</tt> is a <tt>JComponent</tt> which is not
 * really transparent, but only looks like. It overrides the
 * <code>paintComponent</code> method of <tt>JComponent</tt> to paint its
 * own background image, which is an exact image of the screen at the position
 * where the window will appear and with the same size. The
 * <tt>java.awt.Robot</tt> class is used to make the screen capture.
 * <p>
 * Note that the effect of transparence is gone when behind there is an
 * application which shows dynamic images or something the moves, like
 * a movie for example.
