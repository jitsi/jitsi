/**
 * The Jabber implementation of the service.protocol.ContactGroup interface. There
 * are two types of groups possible here. <tt>RootContactGroupJabberImpl</tt>
 * which is the root node of the ContactList itself and
 * <tt>ContactGroupJabberImpl</tt> which represents standard groups. The
 * reason for having those 2 is that generally, Jabber groups may not contain
 * subgroups. A contact list on the other hand may not directly contain buddies.
 *
 *
 * The reason for having an abstract class is only - being able to easily
 * recognize our own (Jabber) contacts.
