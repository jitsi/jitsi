/**
 * AnimatedImage will display a series of Images in a predetermined sequence.
 * This sequence can be configured to keep repeating or stop after a specified
 * number of cycles.
 * 
 * An AnimatedImage cannot be shared by different components. However,
 * the Images added to the AnimatedImage can be shared.
 * 
 * The animation sequence is a simple sequential display of each Image. When the
 * end is reached the animation restarts at the first Image. Images are
 * displayed in the order in which they were added. To create custom animation
 * sequences you will need to override the getNextIconIndex() and
 * isCycleCompleted() methods.
