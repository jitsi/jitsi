/**
 * The class is used to represent the state of the connection of a given
 * ProtocolProvider or Contact. It is up to the implementation to determine the
 * exact states that an object might go through. An IM provider for example
 * might go through states like, CONNECTING, ON-LINE, AWAY, etc, A status
 * instance is represented by an integer varying from 0 to 100, a Status Name
 * and a Status Description.
 *
 * The integer status variable is used so that the users of the service get the
 * notion of whether or not a given Status instance represents a state that
 * allows communication (above 20) and so that it could compare instances
 * between themselves (e.g. for sorting a ContactList for example).
 *
 * A state may not be created by the user. User may request a status change
 * giving parameters requested by the ProtocolProvider. Once a statue is
 * successfully entered by the provider, a ConnectivityStatus instance is
 * conveyed to the user through a notification event.
