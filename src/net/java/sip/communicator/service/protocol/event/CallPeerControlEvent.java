/**
 * The CallPeerControlEvent is issued by the PhoneUIService as a result
 * of a user request to modify the way a CallPeer is associated with a
 * call, or in other words "Answer" the incoming call of a CallPeer or
 * "Hangup" and thus and the participation of a CallPeer in a call. The
 * source of the event is considered to be the CallPeer that is being
 * controlled. As the event might also be used to indicate a user request to
 * transfer a given call peer to a different number, the class also contains
 * a targetURI field, containing the address that a client is being redirected to
 * (the target uri might also have slightly different meanings depending on the
 * method dispatching the event).
