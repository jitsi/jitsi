/**
 * RFC [RFC 5285] defines a mechanism for attaching multiple extensions to
 * RTP packets. Part of this mechanism consists in negotiating their
 * identifiers using <tt>extmap</tt> attributes pretty much the same way one
 * would negotiate payload types with <tt>rtpmap</tt> attributes.
 * <p>
 * Mappings of extension IDs are handled with SDP. They are created for
 * a particular session and remain the same for its entire lifetime. They may
 * however change in following sessions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We use this class as a utility for easily creating and tracking extension
 * mappings for the lifetime of a particular session. One instance of this
 * registry is supposed to be mapped to one media session and they should
 * have the same life cycle.
