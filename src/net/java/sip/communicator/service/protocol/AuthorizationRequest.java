 * This class is used to represent both incoming and outgoing

 * <p>
 * An outgoing Authorization Request is to be created by the user interface
 * when an authorization error/challenge has been received by the underlying
 * protocol. The user interface or any other bundle responsible of handling
 * such requests is to implement the AuthorizationHandler interface and register
 * itself as an authorization handler of a protocol provider. Whenever a request
 * needs to be sent the protocol provider would ask the the AuthorizationHandler
 * to create one through the createAuthorizationRequest() method.
 * <p>
 * Incoming Authorization requests are delivered to the ProtocolProviderService
 * implementation through the AuthorizationHandler.processAuthorizationRequest()
 * method.
