/**
 * The Account Info Operation set is a means of accessing and modifying detailed
 * information on the user/account that is currently logged in through this
 * provider. This operation set is more or less equivalent to
 * OperationSetServerStoredContactInfo with the most essential difference being the
 * fact that the account info operation set allows you to modify data in
 * addition to reading it (quite natural given that it's your own info that
 * you're dealing with).
 * <p>
 * Examples of account details are your picture, postal or e-mail addresses,
 * work, hobbies, interests, and many many others.
 * <p>
 * Various types of details have been defined in the ServerStoredDetails class
 * and can be used with the get methods of this interface. Implementors may also
 * define their own details by extending or instantiating the
 * ServerStoredDetails.GenericDetail class. Yet, they are encouraged to use
 * existing detail types as fully as possible. Defining your own detail type
 * may lead to limited visualization of its value.
 * <p>
 * As mentioned earlier the operation set supports adding, removing or replacing
 * various details. The exact set of details that can be manipulated through
 * this operation set depends on the implementation and can be retrieved through
 * the getSupportedDetailTypes() method. The maximum number of detail instances
 * supported for a given type of details can be retrieved through the
 * getMaxDetailInstances() method.
 * <p>
 * The OperationSetServerStoredAccountInfo only concerns us (the user currently
 * logged through this provider) and our own details. In order to query details
 * concerning Contacts in our contact list we'd need to use the
 * OperationSetServerStoredContactInfo
