/**
 * The ProtocolProvider interface should be implemented by bundles that wrap
 * Instant Messaging and telephony protocol stacks. It gives the user interface
 * a way to plug into these stacks and receive notifications on status change
 * and incoming calls, as well as deliver user requests for establishing or
 * ending calls, putting peers on hold and etc.
 * <p>
 * An instance of a ProtocolProviderService corresponds to a particular user
 * account and all operations performed through a provider (sending messages,
 * modifying contact lists, receiving calls)would pertain to this particular
 * user account.
 *<p>
 * ProtocolProviderService instances are created through the provider factory.
 * Each protocol provider is assigned a unique AccountID instance that uniquely
 * identifies it. Account id's for different accounts are guaranteed to be
 * different and in the same time the ID of a particular account against a given
 * service over any protocol will always be the same (so that we detect attempts
 * for creating the same account twice.)
