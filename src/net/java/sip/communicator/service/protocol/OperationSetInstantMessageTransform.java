/**
 * The Instant Message Transform operation set allows, when \
 * supported to insert message transform layers that could change incoming
 * messages before they are delivered to the user and outgoing ones before
 * they reach the protocol stack and get sent. One use case of this operation
 * set is support of upper layer encryption mechanisms like OTR. Other cases may
 * include hyperlink presentation, support for wiki words etc.
 * <p/>
 * Important Notice: As of May 5 2009, this operation set is still a work in
 * progress and may change significantly in the following months. Any work based
 * on this interface is therefore likely to require frequent updates to keep
 * compatibility.
