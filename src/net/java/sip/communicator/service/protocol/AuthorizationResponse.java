 * An outgoing Authorization Response is to be created by the user interface

 * interface or any other bundle responsible of handling such responses is to
 * implement the AuthorizationHandler interface and register itself with a
 * protocol provider. Whenever a response needs to be sent the protocol provider
 * would ask the the AuthorizationHandler to create one through the
 * processAuthorizationRequest() method.
 * <p>
 * Incoming Authorization responses are delivered to the AuthorizationHandler
 * implementation through the AuthorizationHandler.processAuthorizationResponse()
