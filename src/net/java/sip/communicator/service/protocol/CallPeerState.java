/**
 * The CallPeerState class reflects the current state of a call
 * peer. In other words when you start calling your grand mother she will
 * be in a INITIATING_CALL state, when her phone rings her state will change to
 * ALERTING_REMOTE_SIDE, and when she replies she will enter a CONNECTED state.
 *
 * <p>Though not mandatory CallPeerState would generally have one of the
 * following life cycles
 *
 * <p> In the case with your grand mother that we just described we have:
 * <br>INITIATING_CALL -> CONNECTING -> ALERTING_REMOTE_USER -> CONNECTED -> DISCONNECTED
 *
 * <p> If your granny was already on the phone we have:
 * <br>INITIATING_CALL -> CONNECTING -> BUSY -> DISCONNECTED
 *
 * <p>Whenever someone tries to reach you:
 * <br>INCOMING_CALL -> CONNECTED -> DISCONNECTED
 *
 * <p>A FAILED state is prone to appear at any place in the above diagram and is
 * generally followed by a disconnected state.
 *
 * <p>Information on call peer is shown in the phone user interface until
 * they enter the DISCONNECTED state. At that point call peer information
 * is automatically removed from the user interface and the call is considered
 * terminated.
