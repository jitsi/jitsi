/**
 * The <tt>WizardPage</tt> represents a page in a <tt>WizardContainer</tt>.
 * A page has a unique identifier. Each page should specify the identifier
 * of both next and previous page to be displayed when user clicks "Next"
 * or "Back" wizard button. These identifiers will be used from the
 * <tt>WizardContainer</tt> to determine, which page should be displayed
 * when the "Next" wizard button is clicked and which when "Back" is clicked.
 * <p>
 * In the construction of an account registration wizard container the UI
 * Service implementation could implement this interface to define
 * a Default wizard page and a Summary page. Each
 * <tt>AccountRegistrationWizard</tt> could obtain the identifier of both
 * Default and Summary page from the corresponding
 * <tt>AccountRegistrationWizardContainer</tt>, where it is added.
 * <p>
 * The predefined FINISH_PAGE_IDENTIFIER should be used to mark the end of
 * a wizard.
