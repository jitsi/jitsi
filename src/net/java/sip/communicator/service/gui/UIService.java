/**
 * The <tt>UIService</tt> offers generic access to the graphical user interface
 * for all modules that would like to interact with the user.
 * <p>
 * Through the <tt>UIService</tt> all modules can add their own components in
 * different menus, toolbars, etc. within the ui. Each <tt>UIService</tt>
 * implementation should export its supported "pluggable" containers - a set of
 * <tt>Container</tt>s corresponding to different "places" in the application,
 * where a module can add a component.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>UIService</tt> provides also methods that would allow to other
 * modules to control the visibility, size and position of the main application
 * window. Some of these methods are: setVisible, minimize, maximize, resize,
 * move, etc.
 * <p>
 * A way to show different types of simple windows is provided to allow other
 * modules to show different simple messages, like warning or error messages. In
 * order to show a simple warning message, a module should invoke the
 * getPopupDialog method and then one of the showXXX methods, which corresponds
 * best to the required dialog.
 * <p>
 * Certain components within the GUI, like "AddContact" window for example,
 * could be also shown from outside the UI bundle. To make one of these
 * component exportable, the <tt>UIService</tt> implementation should attach to
 * it an <tt>WindowID</tt>. A window then could be shown, by invoking
 * <code>getExportedWindow(WindowID)</code> and then <code>show</code>. The
 * <tt>WindowID</tt> above should be obtained from
 * <code>getSupportedExportedWindows</code>.
