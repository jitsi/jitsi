/**
 * The purpose of this class is to help avoid the significant delays that occur
 * in networks where DNS servers would ignore SRV, NAPTR, and sometimes even
 * A/AAAA queries (i.e. without even sending an error response). We also try to
 * handle cases where DNS servers may return empty responses to some records.
 * <p>
 * We achieve this by entering a redundant mode whenever we detect an abnormal
 * delay (longer than <tt>DNS_PATIENCE</tt>)  while waiting for a DNS response,
 * or when that response is not considered satisfying.
 * <p>
 * Once we enter redundant mode, we start duplicating all queries and sending
 * them to both our primary and backup resolvers (in case we have any). We then
 * always return the first response we get, regardless of who sent it.
 * <p>
 * We exit redundant mode after receiving <tt>DNS_REDEMPTION</tt> consecutive
 * timely and correct responses from our primary resolver.
